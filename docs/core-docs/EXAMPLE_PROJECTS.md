# Example Projects - COMING SOON!

As the Common Mapping Client expands, we'll be creating applications to demonstrate various extensions/modifications that can be applied to this tool.

We hope that developers can use these projects as guides/inspiration for features to include in their own applications without needing to inflate CMC Core to accomodate various non-essential features or components.
