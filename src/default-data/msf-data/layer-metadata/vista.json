    "description": "The Vista-CA infrastructure layers shown here are a Geographic Information System (GIS) data set developed by our co-Investigator Dr. Francesca Hopkins and her team at University of California Riverside. It is described in an https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-653-2018. Vista-CA maps potential methane emitting infrastructure across the State of California and is used to guide flight planning and for source attribution following detection of methane plumes.  Vista-CA maps the locations of infrastructure associated with three primary sectors (energy, agriculture, and waste) following the frameworks used by the State of Californiaâ€™s Greenhouse Gas Inventory and the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for GHG Reporting.  Vista-CA contains 450,572 distinct pieces of potential methane emitting infrastructure components in California including meta-data about each component.  This includes individual point elements such as oil and gas wells as well as polygons showing the extent of surrounding oil and gas fields and other large facilities such as refineries and landfills. For some sectors we do not yet have the spatial extents mapped and so only report an individual point icon, typically recording a public records street address for each facility. Additionally, the Vista-CA data set was derived from public records with varying degrees of latency. The facility data is not automatically updated and so the name, operator and other meta-data for each facility may be out of date.
