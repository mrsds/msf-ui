### What does the data show?

1. A relatively small number of high-emitting methane point sources contribute 20 to 50% of total methane emissions in regions surveyed so far.
2. This “super-emitter” activity occurs in multiple economic sectors including energy, waste management and agriculture, with significant regional variations.
3. Many methane point sources are highly intermittent and variable – on average they are only active about 25% of the time; this underscores the need for frequent monitoring.
4. Frequent measurements over large areas can help separate persistent activity (including potential leaks) from more intermittent activity (either infrequent anomalies or planned maintenance events).
5. High resolution remote sensing of methane plumes can pinpoint emissions sources and identify specific equipment for efficient follow up by facility operators and regulators.
6. Accurate quantification of regional methane budgets/inventories benefits from tiered observing systems that apply multiple measurements from different vantage points (e.g., land, air and space) to provide a complete picture of the different types of emitters, including strong point sources and wider area sources.

### What are some findings from the [California Methane Survey](https://ww2.energy.ca.gov/2020publications/CEC-500-2020-047/CEC-500-2020-047.pdf) (2016-2017)?

1. Less than 0.2% of infrastructure elements in the state (based on a survey of 272,000 facilities and components) are responsible for 34–46% of total methane emissions in California.
2. Waste management is the largest methane point source emission sector in California (41% of our study total), driven by a small fraction of landfills; we only observed these plumes at 30 out of 270 surveyed facilities.
3. Methane point source emissions from manure management at large dairies and the oil and gas sector each contributed about 26% of emissions in our study.
4. Nearly 70% of the observed oil and gas point source emissions were associated with oil production in the southern San Joaquin Valley.
5. Our methane emission estimates for petroleum refineries in California are 4.5 times higher than those reported to the EPA.
6. In comparing the California data with an earlier short-duration survey of the Four Corners region using the same methods we see very similar patterns, despite large differences in industrial activity between the two regions.
7. If similar patterns occur in other key regions globally we estimate that methane super-emitters could account for up to 10% of the climate forcing from greenhouse gas emissions

### Are facility operators using the data to repair leaks?

We have ongoing research collaborations with facility operators for a subset of locations where we’ve detected methane point sources. In those cases, we shared our methane image data and source coordinates and the operators responded with ground based follow-up measurements to verify and/or further pinpoint the locations. Several of those follow-up efforts exposed malfunctioning hardware or leaks that the operator was able to repair. Some examples include natural gas infrastructure in California cities such as leaking bypass valves at compressor stations and low-pressure distribution pipelines. In each case the relevant gas company personnel who then confirmed and repaired the leaks. See [here](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22467) for one example. We also shared data over the course of several years with the operators of a large municipal landfill in California who used it to guide improvements in their gas capture systems, described [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7b99/meta).

### Why focus on methane?

Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas—second only to carbon dioxide as a climate-forcing agent resulting from human (anthropogenic) activity. The growth rate of methane in the atmosphere is due to a complex combination of natural and anthropogenic emissions and natural removal processes. The exact causes for observed changes in the methane growth rate over time remain uncertain due to incomplete data and disagreements between different measurement methods. Methane emissions and their causes at local and regional scales remain particularly uncertain. Additionally, methane is also being increasingly prioritized by California and other governments for near-term climate action given its relatively short atmospheric lifetime and the potential for rapid, focused mitigation that can complement economy-wide efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Methane is also a precursor for tropospheric ozone and is strongly linked with co-emitted reactive trace gases targeted by air quality and public health policies in California. Finally, methane vented to the atmosphere from leaks in natural gas infrastructure – if not promptly detected and repaired - can result in costly product loss and (in sufficiently large quantities) a combustion hazard. All of the above factors motivate the need for sharing methane data across a broad range of scales.

### What about other gases?

Ammonia and carbon dioxide are just some of the gases that can be co-emitted with methane from some landfills, dairies, oil fields and power plants. The data presented here is limited to methane given our research focus on greenhouse gases. Some state and local agencies such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and Air Quality Management Districts monitor air quality and criteria pollutants. CARB and the US Environmental Protection Agency also maintain databases of self-reported emissions from large facilities in selected sectors.

### What’s the difference between methane gas concentrations, enhancements and emissions?

The relative amount of methane in a given volume of air is often represented as the methane _concentration_ (or more accurately, the dry air mole fraction). For example, the current global average concentration of near-surface atmospheric methane on earth is about 2 parts per million (ppm).

When methane concentrations in a localized volume of air are much higher than average background concentrations (methane in less polluted nearby air) we refer to that increase as the methane _enhancement_. For example, in the presence of a steady breeze, if a methane emitter results in localized concentrations of 10 ppm and the cleaner upwind air has an average background concentration of 2 ppm we would say that local enhancement is 10−2 ppm = 8 ppm. Methane enhancements can also be represented by absolute mass units; for example, a localized enhancement might contain several kilograms of methane.

An _emission_ is the rate at which methane is generated by a source. For example, the emission rate for a venting gas pipeline compressor station might be 100 kilograms per hour (kg/hr) of methane, equivalent to about 5400 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) of natural gas.

### What are the different types of methane emitters?

An _emitter_ (or emission source) refers to the physical or biological activity that generates methane gas. There are two basic categories of methane emitters: point sources and area sources.

We define a _point source_ to be a condensed surface feature or infrastructure component (typically < 10 meters across) that emits plumes of highly concentrated methane that’s above the detection limit of our remote sensing technology. Examples of point sources include individual pieces of natural gas infrastructure, oil wells, refineries, gas-capture systems in landfills, waste water treatment plants, manure management systems at large dairies and wildfires. Point sources include a relatively small number of super-emitters and a large number of much smaller emitters.

An _area source_ is typically distributed over a large area (typically 1–100 km across) that releases methane in a more diffuse fashion such as anaerobic decomposition occurring with rice cultivation and natural wetlands or enteric fermentation from livestock.

Sometimes the cumulative effect of a large number of low-emitting point sources can manifest as an area source—for example, cities can appear as a large area source due to the combined impact of millions of small natural gas leaks in distribution infrastructure and even downstream of meters in homes and businesses.

### What’s a methane "plume"?

A plume is simply the observed enhancement of methane in the atmosphere, originating from some emission source. This is analogous to smoke from a fire except in many cases methane is due to processes other than combustion.

### Does a very intense methane plume (strong enhancement) mean there’s a large methane source nearby?

Not necessarily. The magnitude of a localized atmospheric enhancement depends on both the emission rate and the degree of local ventilation. Wind speed is usually the biggest factor in ventilation but other atmospheric conditions and local terrain can also play a role, in some cases resulting in “pooling” of methane gas leading to large enhancements near a relatively small emitter. For these reasons, when estimating the emissions from given source we account for both the methane enhancement and atmospheric factors like wind speed.

### How steady or persistent are methane emissions?

Depending on the source activity methane emissions can vary by hour, season or even years. For example, methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure, refineries, power plants and manure management at large dairies are often highly intermittent on time scales of hours due to normal operations such as periodic venting or flaring, but a malfunction or leak can result in persistent emissions. In other cases, methane emissions can sometimes vary strongly from season to season as a function of environmental conditions that effect methane producing bacteria (landfills) or by demand (residential natural gas consumption). Over time spans of several years, we may see trends in emissions in response to mitigation (reduction) or new activity (growth).

### Does the presence of a methane point source indicate a malfunction?

Not necessarily. Some methane emissions (often referred to as “process emissions”) are expected and to some extent are already accounted for in inventories and reporting systems; for example, incomplete combustion during gas flaring, venting from vapor relief valves on gas storage tanks, small losses from compressors or area source emissions from landfills and dairies. Examples of malfunctions include persistent leakage due to faulty seal or valves in gas infrastructure, unlit flares, or damage to a gas capture system at a landfill or dairy. The degree of intermittency or frequency of an emission source can provide an important clue about whether a source is an expected process or a malfunction.

### Is this real-time data?

This is a prototype data portal. Most of the data shown here is based on measurements or data collected some months or years ago. Recent improvements in data processing and analysis tools have made it technically feasible to produce near real-time data however the primary limitation is funding for sustained and frequent observations. Future versions of this data portal will provide lower latency data delivery (ultimately days-weeks).

### What measurement systems were used to produce these data sets?

These data were produced by a combination of remote-sensing from aircraft and satellites and surface-based measurement networks. See info icons for each map layer for specific information. By comparing very high resolution data for individual methane point sources with wide area regional emission maps we can develop broader, multi-scale awareness of emissions.

### Why do some areas show more methane sources than others?

Some areas have more methane sources because they tend to have more activity or infrastructure that generate methane emissions or because those areas were sampled more frequently than other regions. This prototype data portal highlights regions where known concentrations of infrastructure were repeatedly surveyed for methane emissions. While we do not expect to see methane emissions everywhere this is not a comprehensive wall-to-wall accounting.

### Why do dairies produce methane?

There are two main factors that cause dairies to emit methane: enteric fermentation and manure management. Enteric fermentation is a part of the digestive process for cows which causes methane to be expelled from the animal through burping. While enteric fermentation contributes to methane emitted from dairies, the methane emissions from dairies seen in Methane Source Finder are primarily due to a manure management technique involving the use of anaerobic lagoons to store animal waste/manure.

### Are all types of livestock methane emissions shown here?

No, only a subset. The AVIRIS-NG methane point source data includes manure management sources which are a subset of IPCC Source Category 3A: enteric fermentation and manure management. Enteric fermentation manifests as an area source best quantified with other methods and is not included in the current version of this web site.

### What are the biggest categories of methane emissions in California?

According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the majority of methane emissions in California come from agriculture (enteric fermentation 29%, manure management 26%), landfills (22%), and oil and gas extraction (16%). See the [CARB website](https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/background/ch4.htm) for more information.

### What is the difference between a plume and a source?

A methane source is a condensed surface feature or infrastructure component (typically < 10 meters across) that emits plumes of concentrated methane. In cases where we observe multiple instances of a plume at a given location we combine our individual plume emission estimates to derive a source-average emission rate, including the impacts of intermittency.

### Why do some of the Observation Methane Plume and RGB Imagery have black areas on their edges?

These indicate the edge of a flight-line acquired with the airborne imaging spectrometer which has a finite swath width (field of view). We usually plan our flights with 20% line overlap but sometimes we detect a plume at the edge of a mapping area or the wind changes between adjacent lines so that the plume is visible in one line but not the adjacent line, resulting in “clipping”.

### I see some flux values given as Not available or TBD, what does that mean?

For plume observations through 2017, the value will be given as "not available" when the algorithm used to estimate flux from the image data was unable to provide a decent confidence-value. For all 2018 plume imagery, the analysis to estimate flux has not yet been performed (as of July 2019), and is therefore labeled as TBD (to be determined).

### Why is infrastructure metadata available in California but not other regions?

The availability of Geographic Information System (GIS) data regarding facilities and infrastructure varies widely by jurisdictions. For many sectors there are incomplete data sets and/or inconsistent file formats. In California we spent two years compiling and validating a GIS data set called Vista using public records. This effort can be time-consuming and expensive to replicate in other regions and so we do not include GIS infrastructure data outside of California in this prototype data portal. We are working with our research partners to develop global data sets that will ultimately have similar content as Vista.
