### Data Use Policy

Data on the Methane Source Finder portal are made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific and policy insights. The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data or permission to use the data, or information contained in it, for publication or any commercial use.

Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible at the time of their acquisition. However, we reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on scientific grounds, e.g., updates to VISTA infrastructure layers, wind speeds, or recalculation of integrated methane enhancements or emissions in order to improve accuracy or address issues not known at the time of release.

If the data from this portal are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, the Methane Source Finder team should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work. If the Methane Source Finder data are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on the data, it may be appropriate for those obtaining the data to consider co-authorship. It is strongly encouraged that topics be discussed at an early stage in the work. Manuscripts using the data should be sent to the Methane Source Finder team for review before they are submitted for publication to insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented. Sharing of manuscripts will result in a prompt response from team members.

To discuss publication, presentation and collaboration, please contact the Methane Source Finder Team (hyperlink to TBD listserv) describing your plans for use.

### Reciprocity Agreement

Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate, particularly in the case of scientific research efforts where data sharing has the potential to advance the scientific understanding of the systems and or processes involved. Organizations making similar measurements agree to make their best efforts in making their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation of the Methane Source Finder data, namely well documented model code, wind fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions. Model availability includes collaborative support for new users of the models.

### Availability

The Methane Source Finder is currently undergoing commissioning. We plan to continue validating, improving and adding new data sets and features through Fall 2019. Updates will not be provided on a fixed schedule but will be indicated by version/date codes.
