**AVIRIS**: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer

**AVIRIS-NG**: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer â€“ Next Generation. Please see the [instrument web site](https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/) for more information.

**Vista**: A database of geolocated infrastructure that may emit various gases. The data set also includes a variety of metadata, depending on available information from the source data sets. Please see the Vista publication at https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-653-2018 for more information.

**Emission**: An emission is the rate at which methane is generated by a source. This is calculated by combining the total mass of methane in plume, distance, and wind speed.

**Total flyovers**: Total number of times that a location was measured with the airborne imaging spectrometer. 

**Flight-line**: Data acquired by the airborne imaging spectrometer that indicates the path of the airplane as it was collecting data.

**Source**: Condensed surface feature or infrastructure component (typically < 10 meters across) that emits plumes of concentrated methane.

**Plume**: methane emissions observable in AVIRIS-NG images produced by a  methane source.

**Plume detection**: the process of identifying imaging spectrometer pixels representing methane enhancements.
