**AVIRIS**: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer

**AVIRIS-NG**: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer â€“ Next Generation. Please see the [instrument web site](https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/) for more information.

**Vista**: A database of geolocated infrastructure that may emit various gases. The data set also includes a variety of metadata, depending on available information from the source data sets. Please see the Vista publication at https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-653-2018 for more information.

**Emission**: An emission is the rate at which methane is generated by a source. This is calculated by combining the total mass of methane in plume, distance, and wind speed.

**Total flyovers**: Total number of times that a location was measured with the airborne imaging spectrometer. 

**Flight-line**: Data acquired by the airborne imaging spectrometer that indicates the path of the airplane as it was collecting data.

**Source**: Condensed surface feature or infrastructure component (typically < 10 meters across) that emits plumes of concentrated methane.

**Plume**: methane emissions observable in AVIRIS-NG images produced by a  methane source.

**Plume detection**: the process of identifying imaging spectrometer pixels representing methane enhancements.

|Metric (from Andrew)	|Unit|
|-----------------|---|
|IME = integrated methane enhancement (total mass of methane in plume)|	kg CH4|
|r = plume length (also referred to as L)	|meters|
|IME/r = IME divided by plume length	|kg/m|
|sIME/r = uncertainty (standard deviation) in IME/r estimate (also referred to as sIME)|	kg/m|
|U10 = total (vector) wind speed at 10 meters above ground level 	|m/s|
|sU10 = uncertainty in wind speed at 10meters above ground level (also referred to as su10)|	m/s|
|Qplume = instantaneous plume emission rate (single observation)	|kg/hr|
|sQplume = uncertainity in instantaneous plume emission rate (single observation)	|kg/hr|
|Total overflights|	flight lines|
|Source Persistence (f)|	range <0, <1.0|
|probability that true f is >= measured f	|range <0, <1.0|
|Qsource= average source emission rate (calculated from multiple plume observations) (also referred to as Qsource_avg)|	kg/hr|
|sQ_avg  = total uncertainty in average source emission rate (calculated from multiple plume observations)|	kg/hr|
|Qsource_final = average, persistence adjusted source emission rate	|kg/hr|
|sQ_final = total uncertainty in average, persistence adjusted source emission rate	|kg/hr|
