/*
Add configuration entries to this that should be editable
in operations (i.e. after build). This config file is loaded
directly in index.html, without going through webpack.

see `src/constants/appConfig.js` for all configuration options

Note that configuration settings that are not expected to change
during deployment should be made in `src/constants/appConfig.js` directly

EXAMPLE:
The following configuration will change the display title for
the application.
```
APPLICATION_CONFIG = {
	APP_TITLE: "New Title"
};
```

*/

APPLICATION_CONFIG = {
	APP_TITLE: "Methane Source Finder"
};
