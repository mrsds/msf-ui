                                    airborne remote-sensing, surface monitoring networks and
                                    satellites on an interactive map alongside infrastructure

                                    Why focus on methane? Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas
                                    - second only to carbon dioxide as a climate-forcing agent
                                    resulting from human (anthropogenic) activity. The growth rate
                                    of methane in the atmosphere is due to a complex combination of
                                    natural and anthropogenic emissions and natural removal
                                    processes. The exact causes for observed changes in the methane
                                    growth rate over time remain uncertain due to incomplete data
                                    and disagreements between different measurement methods. Methane
                                    emissions and their causes at local and regional scales remain
                                    particularly uncertain. Additionally, methane is also being
                                    increasingly prioritized by California and other governments for
                                    near-term climate action given its relatively short atmospheric
                                    lifetime and the potential for rapid, focused mitigation that
                                    can complement economy-wide efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
                                    emissions. Methane is also a precursor for tropospheric ozone
                                    and is strongly linked with co-emitted reactive trace gases
                                    targeted by air quality and public health policies in
                                    California. Finally, methane vented to the atmosphere from leaks
                                    in natural gas infrastructure â€“ if not promptly detected and
                                    repaired - can result in costly product loss and (in
                                    sufficiently large quantities) a combustion hazard. All of the
                                    above factors motivate the need for sharing methane data across
                                    a broad range of scales.

                                This site provides free access to methane data sets and analytics to help advance collective understanding of methane emissions for science and societal benefit.  This is an experimental rather than operational data portal. This means underlying data sets are not continuous and may be updated infrequently or not at all.  We may also make updates to data sets from time to time in response to new findings from ongoing research and feedback from facility operators.  Users are encouraged to cite the relevant scientific literature describing each data set (see &quot;info&quot; icon for each map layer). Metadata including nearest facility names are based on public data records available at the time the map layers were generated and may not be current. This data set includes over 1000 methane point source plumes, many of which have not been validated by follow-up ground observations and hence attribution errors are possible. We appreciate any feedback however requests for new features, bug fixes or additional data collection are subject to available funding. The information presented here is not intended to reflect any positions by the funding agencies.
